# Machine-Learning-Classification-Model-Capstone-Project

A logistic regression model with factor analysis of mixed data (FAMD)
dimensionality reduction and clustering that predicts the genre of a song. The data set is from an API released by Spotify that reports the audio features of its songs, such as “tempo” or
“energy”. For this model we use the features of 50k randomly picked songs to predict the genre that the
song belongs to.
